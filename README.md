- You're building an issue tracking system
- Build a component which displays the names of assignees
  - eg. `<Assignees assignees={['Mike', 'Sepp', 'David']} />`
  - build a simple ul
- WITH more than 3 assigness,
  - only display 3 assignees
  - display a show more button

- WHEN the show more button was clicked
  - display all assignees
  - a show less button is displayed instead of a show more button
  - AND the show less button was clicked, only displays 3 assignees
- WITH less than 4 assignees,
  - don't display a "show more" button
